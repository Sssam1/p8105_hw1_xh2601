## Problem 1

#### Step 1. Install moderndive package in Console

#### Step 2. Load library and data set

``` r
# load the moderndive library
library(moderndive)
```

``` r
# load the early_january_weather dataset
data("early_january_weather")

# list all variable names in the dataset
names(early_january_weather)
```

    ##  [1] "origin"     "year"       "month"      "day"        "hour"      
    ##  [6] "temp"       "dewp"       "humid"      "wind_dir"   "wind_speed"
    ## [11] "wind_gust"  "precip"     "pressure"   "visib"      "time_hour"

#### Step 3. Review data and write description

Description: After reviewing the data through *?early_january_weather*
and *View(early_january_weather)* in Console, I learned that there are
15 variables in this dataset:  
origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed,
wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour.

origin: EWR airport;  
year: in the year of 2013;  
month: in the month of January; day: for the first 15 days in January;  
hour: for each hour of the day;  
temp: temperature in that hour in Fahrenheit;  
dewp: dewpoint in that hour in Fahrenheit;  
humid: relative humidity;  
wind_dir: wind direction in degrees;  
wind_speed: wind speed in mph;  
wind_gust: wind gust speed in mph;  
precip: precipitation in inches;  
pressure: sea level pressure in millibars;  
visib: visibility in miles;  
time_hour: date and time combined.

The size of this dataset is 358 rows and 15 columns;  
and the mean temperature is 39.5821229 degrees in Fahrenheit.
